322. Coin Change

Given list of coin denominations available, compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.




min_coins[a] = min ( min_coins[a-coin_value] + 1) (run over all coin_values)

Complexity 
O(amount*number of coin denominations)
