Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/description/

Idea:
grow a stack of parantheses

if you see a "(" insert itself + pos tuple
if you see a ")", look at top of stack, pop out a "(" if possible, if not, mark the ")" as a thing to be removed.

at the end, if you have "(" left over, those need to be removed as well
