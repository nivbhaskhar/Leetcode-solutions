2302. Count Subarrays With Score Less Than K

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-with-score-less-than-k/description/


Sliding Window

start ----end 

keep expanding window (by moving end pointer) as long as score < k
once score >= k, move the start pointer up

for every valid window [start, end], all [start+i,end] --> valid as well
so increase count by end-start+1 once you have a valid [start,end] window

score can be efficiently computed by keeping track of sum of window, len of window
