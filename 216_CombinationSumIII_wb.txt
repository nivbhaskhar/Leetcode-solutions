216. Combination Sum III

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/

Idea:

backtracking


          V which max number we can use

[9,8,7,6,5|,4,3,2,1], global ans list = list of answers, current state = [ans list building up], k = how many more numbers we should use, n = sum we want to reach


recurse,

add a valid number to current state

if at end leaf node (i.e. k == 1), check if we have a valid ans to add to global ans list
if yes, add and remove any changes you made to state


if at non leaf node, try adding various numbers to state and recurse, after that reset state

if at n<=0 at any point, return as invalid stage to be in
