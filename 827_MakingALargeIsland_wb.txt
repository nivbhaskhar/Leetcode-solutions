827. Making A Large Island


Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/making-a-large-island/description/

Idea:


cells with 1 --> nodes

connect with edge if they are adjacent cells

find connected components + sizes


need 

component: size

each cell : which component it belongs


---


making a 0 cell to 1:



look at its nbhrs:

   ?
 ? 0 ?
   ?
 

if make it 0, new component of size 1 + (size of component of rep in it)

pick the best such cell

---

time complexity :

DFS --> O(n^2 + 4n) = O(V+E) for graph

the O(n^2) --> to decide which 0 to tur to 1

space complexity :

store : {component: size}, {cell: which component it belongs to} --> O(n^2)
