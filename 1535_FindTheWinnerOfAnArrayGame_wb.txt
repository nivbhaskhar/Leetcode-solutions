1535. Find the Winner of an Array Game

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-winner-of-an-array-game/description/

Idea:

a number will win the first round if it is > all numbers in front of it.

max number once it starts playing will always win, so no need to worry about a number which loses and then comes to battle second time...



if it loses a first round --> it can never win again


so concentrate on numbers which can win the first round --> 1

and check that it's larger than k-1 numbers following it --> will win k consecutive rounds


inefficient algorithm

do a linear scan for each number --> to see if bigger than all numbers in front of it and k-1 numbers behind it..

O(n^2) 

need to do letter as array length is 10^5


if k >= n: only max will win

assume k <= n-1


after more thought:

val at pos i is a candidate if it is max in 

[...i [..k-1. entries..]] if i>=1

[0 [...k entries]]  if i=0


if i is 0, look at [0,1..., k] --> val at 0 has to be max
if i >= 1, look at [0,...i-1, i, ......i+k-1] --> val at i has to be max


need to compute max of prefix arrays for [:k+1], [:k+2], .... [:n = k+n-k], n = len(arr)


what about candidates at pos > n-k ? --> only if max is there, it will win..

        n-k+1
