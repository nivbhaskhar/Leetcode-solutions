636. Exclusive Time of Functions

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/description/


Idea:


sort by time stamp


keep putting job_no, start_time in stack

if you hit job_no, end_time :: it should match with top of stack --> if after removing stack is not empty, do nothing

 time of job += (end_time-start_time+1)


 if stack is not empty at this point: time_of_job_of last entry in stack -= (end_time-start_time+1)

repeat
..


0,s,0

1,s,6
1,e,7

0,e, 7


when you process 1,e,7

--> 1: 7-6+1
---> 0: -(7-6+1). --> remove this time spent in the function just prev, since you'll be adding in a bigger interval later..


when you process 0,e,7

--> 1:2, 0: -1 + (7-0+1) = 7
