34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array


[5,7,7,8,8,10]

012345  
s s+1 s+2 ... s+(e-s)

Modified binary search (take searching for first/last index as a parameter)


mid-point = floor(n/2)
if target < mid-point:
   search f, l in l[0:mid-point]

if target > mid-point:
   search for f,l in l[mid-point+1:]

if target == mid-point:
   search for f in l[0:mid-point]. If nothing, f = mid-point
   search for l in l[midpoint+1:]. If nothing, l = mid-point
   
Complexity 

O(log n)
