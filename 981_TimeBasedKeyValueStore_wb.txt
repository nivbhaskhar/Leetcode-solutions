981. Time Based Key-Value Store 

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/description/

Idea:
timestamps are increasing --> so binary search for timestamps for a given key


store as dict {key : [list of (timestamp, values)]


Complexity

P put operations
G get operations


L = max(key lengths)


1 put operation : O(L) for hashing

all put operations : so O(LP)

1 get operation: O(L) for hashing,  binary search O(log P) so O(L log P)
all get operations = O(G L log P)

total = O(LP) + O(GL log P)
