Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description

Idea:
need to merge two sorted arrays in place (in 1st array which has extra space)


to do it without extra space

<a b c---> <empty space .....>

<x y z ......>



start filling largest elements in the empty space

i.e. merge sort from the ends of the list

if you use up a number from the 1t array, make the slot empty
