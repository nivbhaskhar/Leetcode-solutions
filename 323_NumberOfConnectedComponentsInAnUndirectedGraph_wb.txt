323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/description/

Idea:

Do DFS on each unvisited node --> each time you do a dfs, num components increases by 1


Union find algorithm
start with every node being in its own component

each component always needs a representative, to start with every node is a component and its own rep

as you process each edge, a--b

need to take "union" of component(a), component(b)

this involves:

pick a component at random (say component(a))
update rep of all nodes of component(b) to rep of component(a)


at the end, return number of components
