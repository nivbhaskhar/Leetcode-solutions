351. Android Unlock Patterns

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/android-unlock-patterns/description/

Idea:
define an is_valid function given a sequence
iterate over all possible sequences


another option is to extend a valid sequence digit by digit [backtrack/iteratively construct new valid seq from older ones]
