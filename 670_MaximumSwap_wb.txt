670. Maximum Swap

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-swap/description/

Idea:

keep track of digits: last occurence position

sort digits in descending order

go through zip(original digits, sorted digits):
  first time there's a disparity, you need to swap out the original digit and sorted digit 
  there might be multiple copies of the sorted digit, swap out with the last such digit


eg

digits = 9288

last ocurrence pos
9 :0
2: 1
8:3

sorted:
9882

look at zip(9288,9822)
  9 = 9 OK
 2 != 8 --> need to swap 2 and 8, but which 8? the 8 at pos 3

so 

9288
 ^ ^

swap gives

9882
