19. Remove Nth Node From End of List


Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/


Idea:
2 pass solution:

find length of list = l
removing n-th node from end = removing l-n + 1th node from beginning

if l == n --> return head.next

otherwise if l-n+1 is a valid node (i.e between 1 and l, walk to l-n th node and update its next to next.next)

return head


1 pass solution:

if list is length n, n-th node from end = 1
if list is length n+1, n-th node from end = 2

1 2 ...... n=l n+1=l n+2 =l 

            1   2     3


have two pointers

first pointer is at n+k, k=0,1,.....
second pointer is at k

and need to remove the k+1st node


if you reach end of list before first pointer is at n+k, k>=0, then raise ValueError
