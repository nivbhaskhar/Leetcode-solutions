18. 4Sum

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/description/

Idea:

k = 4

pick k-2 indices and sum the numbers at their values = s
solve for finding 2 numbers that sum to target - s in the subarray after the k-2 indices

edge case: unique quadruples are needed, I just used a set to delete the non-unique answers..

edge case : what if for a given k-2 indices, there are more than 1 (a,b) which completes the solution.. -> we need to include ALL solutions

Complexity

two-sum - O(n)
O(n^k-2) k-2. tuples

so O(n^k-1)
