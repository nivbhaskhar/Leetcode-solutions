249. Group Shifted Strings

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/group-shifted-strings/description/

Idea:
get a tuple rep of a string

eg "abc" = (b-a, c-b)
eg "x" = ()

and maintain a dict of {tuple rep: [list of strings associated to it]}

return the values of the dictionary


edge case :

az ---> [z-a]

ba ---> [a-b]

a ....z

0     25



-1 == 25 mod 26

remember to make the rep mod 26

time complexity:
need to go through each string once --> O(num strings given)
to get a numerical rep of each string --> O(len(string))

so totally O(len(characters) across all strings)

space complexity :
same as O(len(characters))
