352. Data Stream as Disjoint Intervals

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/data-stream-as-disjoint-intervals/description/


Idea:


3*10^4 calls -- add, get intervals

10^2 calls for get intervals


hrve {start:end}, {end:start}, a data structure storing all starts so far






when you add a number ---  x --


check if new number/number already in collection -- HOW ?

if new number

is x-1 the end of a sequence ? if yes, can add x to x-1 end



if x+1 start of a sequence ? if yes, can add [x+1..] to x wherever x goes



how to detect if x is new or is in collection ?

ssearch for start just before x or at x...


if start < x and start..end < x --> x not in collection

if end >= x, then x in collection


need to maintain the starts in sorted order and ability to find pred of a value efficiently, insert and remove vals efficiently and get sorted vals efficiently


---> data structure is Balanced Binary Search Tree
