2859. Sum of Values at Indices With K Set Bits

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-values-at-indices-with-k-set-bits/description/

Idea:
counting 1s in bit rep

get least significant bit for a number --- n & 1
set n = n without its least significant bit

n = n >> 1

same as n >>= 1

---

Apparently Python 3.10 and above has inbuilt method for integers

x.bit_count() which efficiently counts the number of 1s in bin rep

in python 3.9 and below, you need to do bin(x).count('1') or something which is less efficient
