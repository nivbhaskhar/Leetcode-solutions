2483. Minimum Penalty for a Shop

Problem :
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-penalty-for-a-shop/description/


Idea:
Open: see 'N' --> +1
Closed : see 'Y' -> +1



two pass solution + O(N) memory:

keep track of {num N, num Y till each pos}


penalty if closing at pos i = number of Ns till pos[i-1] + number of Ys from pos[i:]

choose min penalty



one pass solution:

total N , total Y --> n, m

maintain total N in prefix [:i] and total Y in suffix [i:]
penalty = total N in prefix + total Y in suffix

for pos i= n-1 to 0:
 if see 'Y':
    increment total Y in suffix
 if see 'N':
    decrement total N in prefix

 compute penalty

keep track of min penalty and return the winning i

O(1) space complexity
