1762. Buildings With an Ocean View

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/buildings-with-an-ocean-view/description/

Idea:


simpler solution:

a building is not blocked iff it's larger than anything to its right
go from right to left and keep the max seen so far
if current building beats anything seen so far, add it to the unblocked list

return reversed of list
O(n)

less efficient solutin:

sort (index, building ht)

look at [i0, i1, ....] where i0 = index of tallest building etc

..... i0....


i0 will block everything before it [i.e i0 of them]

if i1 falls before i0, it doesn't block anything new
if it falls after i0, it blocks everything from [i0+1....i1-1] -- edge case if ht of i1 == ht of i0, it will block i0 also

keep the rightmost index, ht and see where the new i_j falls ..
O(nlog n)
