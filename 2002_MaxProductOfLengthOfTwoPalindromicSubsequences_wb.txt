2002. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Subsequences

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-the-length-of-two-palindromic-subsequences/



See problem #516 to find the longest palindromic subseq in a string

Basically, partition string into 2 disjoint subseq -- (i.e. pick a set of positions for subseq 1 and put the remaining positions into subseq 2)

for each subseq --> treat as a string, and find longest palindromic subseq in it
find the product

take the max over all paritions of string into 2 disjoin subseq


complexity -

O(2^n) pairs of disjoint sequences for string of length n
O(n^2) to find longest subseq
O(2^n) to make a scan of largest product

so overall O(2^n * n^2) complexity
