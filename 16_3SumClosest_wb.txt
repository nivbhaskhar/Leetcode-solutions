16. 3Sum Closest

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/

Idea:

given an integer array, and integer target, find 3 ints in nums so that it is closest to target, return sum 

nums : 500

500^3 = 125*10^6 --> brute force O(N^3)

sort nums

to find sum of 2 ints closest to target, 
  [start end]
  s = num[start] + num[end], 
  s>target, move end pointer back
  s< target, move start ahead
  keep track of least difference to target
  linear time 

x+y+z, fix x: find y, z ~ target-x 

can assume (x,y,z) where x<=y<=z, so if using x, only search in nums[pos_x+1:] for y, z


complexity

N*N + N log N --> N^2
