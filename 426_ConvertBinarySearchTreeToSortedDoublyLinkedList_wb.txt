426. Convert Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly Linked List

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-search-tree-to-sorted-doubly-linked-list/description/


Idea:


recursive function / in order traversal


call on root ---> outputs max and min in subtree
 inside:

 left_max, left_min = call on left subtree
 right_max, right_min = call on right subtree

 left_max --> link to root. (right link) also make root --> left_max (left link)
 root --> link to right_min (right link) also make root --> right_min (left link)
 
 output min = left_min, max = right_max


this will make a doubly linked list

but for circular, finally link the last min and max... , i.e max successor = min predecessor


base cases:

if leaf node: min = max = itself

if only one subtree:

    4
  2
0   3

min/max will be itself...
