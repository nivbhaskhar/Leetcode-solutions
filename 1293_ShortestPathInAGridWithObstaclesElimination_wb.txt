1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/description/

Idea:
If there is no obstacle elimination, it's a BFS from start vertex to end vertex [level of a vertex = number of steps from start to the vertex]

The trick to manage obstacle elimination is to have vertices to be (x,y, number of obstacles you can eliminate still)

so (x,y,3) --> means you are at position (x,y) and can kill 3 more obstacles.

So 
    
   y y+1  
x  0 *


even if there is an obstacle next to (x,y) at (x,y+1), 

you have a move/edge from 
(x,y,3) ---> (x,y+1,2)

where 3 becomes 2 [since you have killed 1 obstacle more]



So vertices are (x,y,i) where i could be anything between 0 and k included.

Do BFS with start vertex (0,0,k)
And if you hit (m-1,n-1,i) for any i for the first time, the level of that vertex = min number of steps!
