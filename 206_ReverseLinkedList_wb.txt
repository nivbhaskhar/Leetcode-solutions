206. Reverse Linked List

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/

Idea:

recursive:
returns the node if it's the end node [N->None]
else recurses on node's next 

  [N->next-...] ---> [next<-...<-end] (have access to end node due to return of recursive call)
   adds next->N and N-> None arrow

   returns the end node


iterative:

maintain prev node, current node, next node

in loop:
current node -> prev node

update prev node to current node
current node to next node


continue till current node is not None

return prev node
