167. Two Sum II

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/

Idea: 
want to find x, y so that nums[x]+nums[y] == target and x!=y

you are also given array is sorted

start with 2 pointers, start at 0 and end at the end of nums

check if nums[start] + nums[end] == target
if sum is > target, move the end pointer to the left
if sum is < target, move the start pointer to the right
if sum is = target, return [start, end]


complexity:

time: linear
