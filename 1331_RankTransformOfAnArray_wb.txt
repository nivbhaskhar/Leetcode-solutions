1331. Rank Transform of an Array

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-transform-of-an-array/description/

Idea:
sort array by its value, pos

so [100,100,1] ---> [(2,1), (0,100), (1,100)] **

create a ranks array of 0s 


go through the sorted array **

rank = 0

for pos, val in sorted array
  if current val > prev_val: 
     increment rank and update ranks[pos]
  prev_val = current_val


this is O(nlogn) time complexity + O(n) space complexity



if too many duplicates --> can sort list[set[numbers]] instead and create rank :  val == pos

then walk through the array and look up its rank
