2817. Minimum Absolute Difference Between Elements With Constraint


Problem : 
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-between-elements-with-constraint/description/


Idea : 

data structure :

easily find a number to left and right of a given number --> log(n)

can easily insert elements -> log(n)



balanced binary search tree --- for each node, all elements on left are smaller, all elements on right are bigger....



-- end pointer at x

keep all numbers between 0-end-x in data structure
if nums[end] = val, search for n1, n2 just to left and right of val in data structure
keep track of min of abs(val-n1), abs(val-n2) as you iterate end from x to last place of array
