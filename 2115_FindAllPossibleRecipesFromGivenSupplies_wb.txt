2115. Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-possible-recipes-from-given-supplies/description/

Idea:

recipe 1: {x,y,z,...,}
recipe2 : {x,y,recipe1...}


memodict


initialize with supplies
{

bread: True
flour:  True
corn: True..
..
}

write a recursive function which checks if cn create a new recipe:

if in memo_dict --> already know.

if not, check if can_create each ingredient recursively

finally update memo dict and return

bug: if there's a cycle, i.e r1 needs r2 ... needs rn needs r1 ---> recursion infinite

maintain visited -- if checking a new recipe, add to visited

if you call can_create on a recipe which is not in memo dict but is visited, cycle detected and return False after adding to memo_dict

-----

cleaner:

do topological sort if possible of graph



add nodes of supplies and recipes

add an edge y --> x if x needs y, if x needs a thing not in supplies or recipes --> cannot make x, delete x from nodes

in degree 0 --> remove

add new in degree 0 to recipes that can be created..
