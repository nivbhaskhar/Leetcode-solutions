380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/description/

Idea:


values = list of values
values_to_positions = {val : position of value in list}


insert:
if value is in values to positions (o(1) look up), do nothing
otherwise append value to end of list
also add value: position = length of value list-1 to the dictionary


remove:

if val not in values to positions, do nothing
otherwise

switch the last value in list with the value to be removed

val to be removed = a in pos p
last val = b in pos -1 (note: a could be same as b and p could be -1)

....a.....b
    p....-1



switch


.....b....b
     p....-1


update b: p in values to positions

left with {a:p, b:p}

remove b from list
......b....*
......p.....

if b=a

would look like
.........*
.........-1

only thing left to do is to remove {a:p} from dictionary

left with {b:p} if a!=b and {} if a=b


get random

pick random number from 0.... len of values-1 inclusive

return values[random number]
