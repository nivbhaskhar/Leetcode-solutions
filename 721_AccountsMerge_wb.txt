721. Accounts Merge

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/description/

Idea:


node

pos:
name: 
accounts = set()

email : [list of positions in which it occurs..., i.e. all these nodes have an edge to each other]


run dfs 


[connected components]-> [1,2,3,...]


merge of the component


can do union find, but seems more involved


one tip :

the graph is set up as a cluster of complete subgraphs
this is not neeeded, if all we want to to is merge connected components

so instead of i-j for all [i, j in set of vertices]

do vertex0 -- i for all other i in set of vertices

i.e.


star shaped subgraph where 1 vertex connected to all other vertices by edge
