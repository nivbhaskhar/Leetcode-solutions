766. Toeplitz Matrix

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/toeplitz-matrix/description/


Idea:

start pos = [(0,i) for i in range(num_cols)] U [(i,0) for i in range(1,num_rows)]

next[x,y] = x+1,y+1

just go diagonally from each start pos and check if all values are same

O(nm) where matrix is m x n
