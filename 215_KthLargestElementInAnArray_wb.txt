215. Kth Largest Element in an Array


Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/

Idea:

do the initial bit of quick sort..


pick a pivot, in place do ...[< pivot, > pivot, = pivot]

decide where the k-th largest element will lie and recurse..

avg time complexity

T(n) = O(n) + T(n/2) --> hoping pivot will reduce search space by half..

this is O(n)
