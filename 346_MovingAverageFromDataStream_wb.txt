346. Moving Average from Data Stream

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-average-from-data-stream/

Idea:
have a counter : initially 0

have a heap to store (pos, value) pairs --> (0,val), (1,val1) ,2......

max_size of heap = k


when get a new value:

increment timestamp

check heap size, if < k, add (time_stamp, val)
if >=k, kick out top of heap and then add (time_stamp, val)

return avg of heap


maintain sum of heap in state to compute avg more easily


complexity analysis:

time complexity

each insert operation : --> delete + insert = O(log(k))


space complexity : O(k)

where k = window size



better solution:

why heap, each time only need to pop the oldest element, can use queue!!

time complexity becomes O(1) then
