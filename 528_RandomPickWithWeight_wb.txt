528. Random Pick with Weight


Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/description/

Idea:

n integers

find v_i so that if random r in [0,1]


v_i-1 < r <= v_i --> picking n_i





v_0 = w_0/sum(w)
v_1 = v_0 + w_1/sum(w) = (w_0 + w_1)/sum(w)

..

v_n-1 = sum(w)/sum(w) = 1


[v0,v1,....,v_n-1=1]

given r in [0,1], pick v_i so that r <= v_i --> n_i
