708. Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List


Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-sorted-circular-linked-list/description/
Idea:

initial :
detect inc trend/strictly dec trend ---> if list has > 1 unique element

if inc trend and val is between curr_val and next_val, insert node in between

if strictly dec trend and val is >= curr_val or < next_val, insert node in between


edge case : 1 unique value

so no strictly dec trend, then how to insert val > unique val or val < unique val ?

detect if we see head again --> if next node is head again, insert new val in between

O(N) where N is len of linked list
