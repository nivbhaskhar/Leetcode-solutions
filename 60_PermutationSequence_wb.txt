60. Permutation Sequence

Find the k-th permutation of 1,2,...n

Approach 1 : Find "next-permutation" of a given one.
Then use that to find the k-th permutation


For finding next-permutation 

53421

Find the smallest suffix which is in descending order. (eg : 421). Pick the one to its right. So (3 421). You can rearrange (3421) to get the next permutation.

You want to replace "3" with something from "421". Pick the first number bigger than it.

(4 "321"). Then reverse the suffix to make it ascending (4 123)

The next permutation is "54123"

Complexity

O(n) for finding next-perm. So O(kn) for approach 1



Approach 2 :  The first (n-1)! permutations begin with 1, the second (n-1)! permutations begin with 2 etc. So find out which is the beginning number for the k-th permutation. Then  recurse

l = [a_0,a_1,a_2,...a_{n-1}] ascending

ans_list = []
numbers_allowed = set(range(1,n+1))
find_starting_term(perm_len, k):
    l = q(perm_len-1)! + r
    q = 0, or q=1,r=0 -> 1
    q=1, r > 0 or q=2, r=0 -> 2
    ....
    starting_term = s-th least element in numbers_allowed
    starting_term is the starting_term of perm
    append(starting_term) to ans_list
    delete starting_term from numbers_allowed
    find_starting_term(perm_len-1, r') where r' = r if r > 0 and r'= (perm_len-1)! if r=0

Complexity

O(n) for finding the s-th least number in a list of size n.
Recursion called n times, so O(n^2)
