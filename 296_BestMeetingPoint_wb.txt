296. Best Meeting Point

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-meeting-point/description/

Idea:

minimize \sum_i |x-x_i| + |y-y_i|

minimize \sum_i |x-x_i|, \sum_i |y-y_i|


can group x_is and compute a weighted n_i|x-x_i| for distinct x_is


time complexity:

O(num_rows^2) + O(num_col^2)

--> because computing a candidate sum is O(num_rows) for a given x etc..


space complexity:

O(num_rows) + O(num_cols)


apparently median minimized \sum l1 norms
finding median in this case [bucket sort] can be done in linear time --O(num_rows) + O(num_cols)
