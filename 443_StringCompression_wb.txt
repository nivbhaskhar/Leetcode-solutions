443. String Compression


Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/description/

Idea:

Used a queue ..

process the characters of the same kind, and append the compression at the end.


However it seemed like creating a queue out of given list created a new copy of the list. The problem wants to modify the list in place


Second Idea:
maintain a pointer (o) to "overwrite_pos", i.e. the place where you can start overwriting


process the characters of the same kind -> you are at place x here, and overwrite the list with the compressed version --> (you'll end up at an updated place o here)

keep processing characters starting from x, and keep overwriting from o

O(n) time complexity and O(1) extra space
