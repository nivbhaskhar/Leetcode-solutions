311. Sparse Matrix Multiplication

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/sparse-matrix-multiplication/description/

Idea:
Have a {row: {col: non_zero_val}} rep of matrix 1
Have a {col: {row: non_zero_val}} rep of matrix 2

have a dot product implementation given row = {col: val} and col = {row:val}

put it together for matrix multiplication

typically to do (m x n) * (n x k) matrix mult, you need to do mk number of dot products where dot product is over two n-vectors

dot product takes n scalar multiplications + sum of these..

so over all O(mkn) scalar multiplications needed


in the sparse rep, we can cut down on needless scalar mult by only multiplying if both entries are non-zero
