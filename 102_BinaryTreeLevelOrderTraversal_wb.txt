102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal


Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).


BFS with a modification


start = root

visited = {root: 0}

current_level = 0

list_of_all_level_lists = []

current_level_list = []

to_be_explored = queue([start])

while to_be_explored:

  pop the queue
  current_vertex = popped vertex
  if level of current_vertex is same as current_level, add current_vertex to current_level_list.
  otherwise: 
    add current_level_list to list_of_all_level_lists
    update current_level = level of current_vertex
    start a new current_level_list = []
    add current_vertex to current_level_list.
    visit unvisited neighbors, add their levels to visited dictionary, add them to to_be_explored.

add the last current_level_list after exiting the while loo[
