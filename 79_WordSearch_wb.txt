79. Word Search

Problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/

Idea:
Backtrack -- cleaner to use recursion to maintain the stack

Assuming you have found word[:s], the recursive function tracks if you can continue this solution to find word[s:] without using the grid letters which were used in word[:s]

the exploration is done dfs style, i.e. you keep trying to explore a nbhr and if it extends to a partial solution, continue trying to expand the partial solution


The main thing to watch out for is to remember to reset the "used grid positions" if the current exploration to continue the solution fails.
