2815. Max Pair Sum in Array

Problem : 
https://leetcode.com/problems/max-pair-sum-in-an-array/


Idea : 
have a sub routine which finds the max digit of a number x (assume positive) --> can be done in O(log x)
cluster nums array by max digit of each number --> can be done in O(|nums|)
eg: nums = [23,34,123,41] --> {3: [23,123], 4:[34,41]} 
for each cluster
--> move max element to end by 1 pass, move the second max element to end but one position in another linear pass
--> sum the max and second max and call it the value of the cluster , if not enough max elements, value = -1
--> can be done in O(size of cluster)

take max(value of cluster) for each cluster

Total complexity = O(|nums|) + (sum over clusters of O(|cluster|)) + O(|nums| log x) where x = max(nums)
